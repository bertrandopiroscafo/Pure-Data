# Pure-Data
This repository contains Pure Data patches written by me.

Lorenz.pd: This patch generates chaotic signals by solving the Lorenz differential equations. Search "Lorenz Attractor" on the web for more information and read papers of Shahrokh Yadegari on Expr, Expr~, Fexpr~ for more explanation about fexpr~. With some set of parameters, the (x,y,z) path stops (normal behavior) and thus here is no more sound. In this case, you have to restore the default parameters (purple bang) and restart (blue bang).
